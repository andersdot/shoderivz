# shoderivz

A hack to show how using the derivates of the evolution of aa physical system, here a simple harmonic oscillator, allow for a quicker evolution. 

This could be applied to planets orbiting around stars, or streams of stars orbiting around the Milky Way. 

In inferences, these speed ups allow for a more efficient exploration of parameter space.
